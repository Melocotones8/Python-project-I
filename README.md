# Python-project-I
'Swords and Boots' game

Hello, 
After acquiring some knowledge and skill in using Python language, I have decided to create my first project, which is a small turn-based game. 
This is the initial version of the game, heavily trimmed compared to what I want to expand on it. 
I chose this version of the project, because I am a fan of this type of games, so working on it brings me a lot of pleasure. 
In this project, I mainly focused on demonstrating skills related to object-oriented programming, code clarity, and logical thinking abilities. 
I will continue to expand on this project. In the near future, I will focus on expanding the game's capabilities (equipment, potions, etc.) and utilizing external libraries, as I plan to develop my knowledge in this area soon. 
I invite you to check and visit this place from time to time, as the game will be constantly improved. 
Enjoy the game!
